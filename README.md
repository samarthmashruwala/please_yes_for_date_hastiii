3. **Send it to your crush** with something like:
   - "Hey, I made something for you 💕"
   - "Check this out when you have a minute 👀"
   - "I'm better at coding than talking, so... 🤷‍♂️"

4. **Wait for the magic to happen** ✨

5. **Try not to stare at your phone every 30 seconds** (we know you will anyway)

### 🎭 Pro Tips from Fellow Nervous Engineers:
- **Best time to send**: Not 3 AM (learned this the hard way)
- **Follow-up strategy**: Give them at least 47 minutes to respond before panicking
- **Backup plan**: If they say no, at least you've got a cool portfolio piece! 🎨

**Remember**: The worst they can say is "no"... or "who is this?"... or "how did you get my number?"... 

Okay, maybe don't overthink it. Just send the link! 💪
